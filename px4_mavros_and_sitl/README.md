## Problem 1

You need to write a high-level controller using this topic in [mavros](https://dev.px4.io/en/ros/mavros_offboard.html) node
```shell
 pose.pose.position.x
 pose.pose.position.y
 pose.pose.position.z
 ```
 that will perform tracking of sinusoidal ```like: y=sin(x)``` using given block diagram

* Note that if find any difficluties in [Gazebo](https://dev.px4.io/en/simulation/ros_interface.html) then try with [jmavsim](https://dev.px4.io/en/simulation/jmavsim.html)
