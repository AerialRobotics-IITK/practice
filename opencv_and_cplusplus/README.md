## Problem 1
### Playing Chess!

There was a boy named "She" and a girl named "He". They were good friends. They once met and decided to play checkers. Unfortunately, none of them had a chekerboard. They discussed among themselves and decided to ask for help. Luckily, they found "You", who was taught OpenCV by "Us". "You" offered to help. Assume yourself to be "You". "You"/You are supposed to develop the said checkerboard. Take image width, image height and side of a single square cell form console and output a single image, image of the required chekerboard.

#### Input:

Single line containing 3 integer values image_width, image_height and side_length.

Note: Assume that image_width and image_height are both integer multiple of side_length.

#### Output:

Save the required image in a .jpg file named "board.jpg"

#### Sample Input:

```512 512 64```
